Big O Notation:
Big O notation describes how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases.

It helps to:

1.Predict performance.

2.Compare algorithms.

3.Choose the most efficient one for large data.



 Best, Average, and Worst-case Scenarios:
 
 For Linear Search:
 
    Best: O(1)
    
    Average: O(n)
    
    Worst: O(n)

For Binary Search:

    Best: O(1)
    
    Average: O(log n)
    
    Worst: O(log n)

4.ANALYSIS:

Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms:

LINEAR SEARCH:

Best Case: O(1) = Item found at the first position.

Average Case: O(n/2) = Simplified to O(n).

Worst Case: O(n) = Item is not present or at the last position.


BINARY SEARCH:

Best Case: O(1) = Item found at the middle index.

Average Case: O(log n).

Worst Case: O(log n) = Search space is halved repeatedly.

Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why:

Binary search is more suitable for an e-commerce platform because it provides faster search times for large sorted data. E-commerce applications often have a large number of products. Since binary search works in O(log n) time, it works well with large product inventories.
